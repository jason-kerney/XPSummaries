Test-driven development is a development practice that focuses on using tests to define behavior and, therefore, the architecture of a software system incrementally. When doing Test-driven Development (TDD), the developer will write a test or a few tests before writing any implementation. They will then write the implementation to pass those tests. Once those tests pass, they will write one or a few additional tests for new functionality and repeat until the product is finished.
