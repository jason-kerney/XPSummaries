## Summary ##

Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where code is compiled and run against every check-in. Every commit to the source code repository compiles all the code and runs all the tests. It is recommended that at least a small portion of the tests execute the full stack to ensure that all parts of the system work together.
    

## Goal ##

The goal of CI is to give the team some assurance that the system is always deployable into production. This practice wants to catch when a breaking change enters the system as close to the creation of the bug as possible. By performing these actions automatically on every commit on remote servers you can ensure that environment issues present on the development machine are not causing false negatives.
    

## Benefits ##

* A more stable code base.
* A safety net that enables quicker development.
* Smaller footprint for bugs to be introduced.
* A nearly always deployable code base.
* Less pain during deployment.
    

## What are my responsibilities ##

### Customer/Product Owner ###

It is everyone’s responsibility to know when the deployment pipeline is broken. A broken pipeline directly effects the customer as it means that features that the customer wants cannot be delivered.

### Coach ###

Help the team see the benefits of a CI pipeline. Get out of the development team’s way when they start to implement. Draw attention to when the pipeline fails and ensure the team retrospects on what caused it.

### Development Team ###

Advocate for a CI pipeline. Take time to learn how to do it correctly, utilize it. If you have branches that don’t run the pipeline, fix that. Pay attention when it breaks.
