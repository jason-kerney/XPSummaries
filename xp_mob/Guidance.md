<!-- (dl (# 1. Decide on the work to be done.)) -->

This works well when the work to be done has any of the following attributes:

* The understanding is unevenly distributed.
* The work is complicated, making it easy to make a mistake.
* The work is complex, and all the requirements of the work being done cannot be known upfront.

<!-- (dl (# 2. Decide how and where you are going to work.)) -->

There are many roles and two positions when doing this type of work. The two positions are Driver and Navigator. The person who has control of the keyboard is the driver. Everyone else is the navigator. The driver's job is to listen to all the navigators and distill that into a coherent change. The navigator's job is to guide at the highest possible level where the changes are going.

The role a person takes on depends on what is needed. It could be someone paying attention to security requirements, coding standards, spelling errors, or whatever seems necessary at the time. You can examine the roles presented in the [Mob Programming Role Playing Game](https://github.com/willemlarsen/mobprogrammingrpg) for ideas of where to start.

It is recommended that you use a practice called Strong Navigation. This means that the person with the idea cannot touch the keyboard. This forces an idea to go through at least one other individual before entering a computer.

It is also recommended that you rotate who is in the Driver position to prevent one person from not having their ideas heard and keep one from feeling stuck. This can be done on a timer, at a logical stopping point, or any other method.

You will need to decide if you are doing Strong Navigation or not and how to rotate the driver position. You will also need to determine where the work will be done. The notion of the same computer is squishy as the intent is that everyone can see the changes done in real time and have access to those changes should they take over.

<!-- (dl (# 3. Collaborate)) -->

This sounds much easier than it is. When collaborating, you must be aware of people not speaking or voices being ignored. Take time to ensure everyone can navigate. If someone is not navigating, ensure it is not because they donâ€™t know what to do. If at any point someone feels lost or out of touch with what is happening, stop and address that. This practice works best when the focus is on ensuring everyone knows how to do things rather than getting things done. Paradoxically, by not focusing on speed, you acquire more speed.
