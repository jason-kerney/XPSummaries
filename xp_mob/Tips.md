* Optimize for learning.
  * Go at the speed of the slowest member.
  * Ensure everyone can explain the solution and why we will use it.
  * Take the opinion of the least qualified member when there is more than one opinion.
* Take frequent breaks; this high-bandwidth collaboration is tiring.
* Respect everyoneâ€™s voice/opinion.
* Look for when someone is not speaking.
* Start by rotating the driver on a time limit.
  * Go smaller than you think is reasonable and grow from there.
* Do not accept low amounts of collaboration. If collaboration is down, dig into why.
* Start with micro retros approximately every 20 minutes to tune the group communications.
