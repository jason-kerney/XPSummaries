Ensemble Development is a practice that brings the whole team together to work in a highly collaborative way. Everybody works on the same thing at the same time, on the same computer. The focus here is active, vibrant communication. The practice does not generate all or any benefits if the communication is stifled, rigid, or non-existent.
