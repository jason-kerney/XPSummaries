Continuous Delivery (CD) is a practice focused on changing the view of the codebase as it is being developed. This view change is forced by pushing every commit/check-in to production even (especially) when the code is unfinished. Since every commit/check-in is pushed to production the focus needs to be building in small increments that do not cause production to fail. It is the idea that every change we make needs to be safe and stable.
