### Combine with Continuous Integration (CI) ###

CD does not really work without the rigor of CI backing it. Starting with CI will make implementing CD easier giving you the benefits of CI/CD. This provides a comprehensive approach to software development and delivery.

### Take an Incremental Approach ###

It is important to note that you don't have to begin with a complete Continuous Delivery (CD) system. In fact, you might realize that a full CD system may not align with your requirements or preferences. Instead, it is recommended to adopt an incremental approach, taking small but measurable steps towards CD implementation. Assess the impact of each step on your teams, delivery process, code quality, and customer satisfaction. Gradually progressing towards a complete CD system will make it more manageable to achieve full CD if it proves beneficial for your organization.

### Use Advanced Techniques as Necessary ###

Advanced techniques like feature toggles, canary releases, Infrastructure as Code, Containerization, and red-blue releases can easily make your life easier or more complex. Understanding what these techniques are and when to use them is essential to getting the most out of CD.
