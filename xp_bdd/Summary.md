Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a practice that focuses on changing the way developers talk about code. It changes the language's focus to business-centric and removes technical jargon. Focusing on business language ensures the developers and the customer use the same terms to mean the same thing. This means that the developers must spend time learning the business domain and gaining insight into the customers' needs, enabling better partnerships.
