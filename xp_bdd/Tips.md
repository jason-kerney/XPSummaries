### Use Tools ###

There are a few tools out there that can minimize the effort in using Behavior-Driven Development. These tools primarily reduce the work of translating the description into executable code. The most popular of these is [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/). Cucumber takes a very structured English description and makes it executable.

### Pair with Domain-Driven Development ###

Domain-Driven Development is a process where the domain of the problem trying to be solved is explored and mapped before development starts and incrementally as development continues. Since Domain-Driven Development is also focused on unifying the language around a domain, it pairs nicely with Behavior-Driven Development.

### Behavior-Driven Development Takes Time to Learn ###

This practice takes time to learn and more time to master. The biggest problem developers face when starting down the path of BDD is that the test project can become unruly. This problem is caused by the developer not knowing how to develop cleanly in this new way of working. The developer needs to focus on the skills that allowed them to be successful and figure out how to apply them in this new context.
