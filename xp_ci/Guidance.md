    <strong>Develop a build script and configure automated tests:</strong>
    <br>
    Create a build script using the tools appropriate with the CI system you are using. This script should compile code, run tests, and generate necessary artifacts. Configure automated testing frameworks to run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate code changes.

    <strong>Integrate CI with version control, define build triggers, monitor builds, and continuously improve the setup:</strong>
    <br>
    Connect your chosen CI platform with the version control system, enabling automatic builds triggered by code changes. Define build triggers such as commits, pull requests, or scheduled builds. Monitor build progress, analyze metrics, test coverage, and code quality reports. Continuously review and refine the CI setup based on feedback, identifying areas for improvement to optimize the CI workflow.
