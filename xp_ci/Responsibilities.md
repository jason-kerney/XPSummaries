<!-- (dl (# Customer/Product Owner)) -->

It is everyone’s responsibility to know when the deployment pipeline is broken. A broken pipeline directly effects the customer as it means that features that the customer wants cannot be delivered.

<!-- (dl (# Coach)) -->

Help the team see the benefits of a CI pipeline. Get out of the development team’s way when they start to implement. Draw attention to when the pipeline fails and ensure the team retrospects on what caused it.

<!-- (dl (# Development Team)) -->

Advocate for a CI pipeline. Take time to learn how to do it correctly, utilize it. If you have branches that don’t run the pipeline, fix that. Pay attention when it breaks.
