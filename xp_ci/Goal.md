The goal of CI is to give the team some assurance that the system is always deployable into production. This practice wants to catch when a breaking change enters the system as close to the creation of the bug as possible. By performing these actions automatically on every commit on remote servers you can ensure that environment issues present on the development machine are not causing false negatives.
