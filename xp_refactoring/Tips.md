### Use an IDE with Refactoring Tools ###

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a tool that makes development easier. Many of these tools have built in refactoring options and/or have plug-ins that provide those options. These will automate the steps taken in a refactoring.

It is worth noting, that these tools are just software and can have bugs just like any other software. As, such, performing an automated refactorings without viability of proof or automated tests is not refactoring even if the tool calls it such.
