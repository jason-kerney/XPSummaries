### Customer/Product Owner ###

The customer has the responsibility to not pressure the team to skip refactoring with-out a very good short term reason and a plan to pay back the effort later.

### Coach ###

The coach has a responsibility to ensure that the team is thinking about constant refactoring opportunities. They are also responsible for protecting the team from external pressures that may lead to refactoring being skipped.

### Development Team ###

The development team is responsible for ensuring that refactoring is happening. Much as a chef cleans as they work, so must the development team. They also must take time to learn and experiment with skills that will enable them to be better at this activity.
