The goal of refactoring is to improve the maintainability of the code. The intent is that the difficulty to change the code remains both a constant and a minimum over the lifetime of the code. You do this by removing micro-architecture errors called "smells". You will never be able to remove all the micro-architecture errors, so you want to target those that are most prominent.
