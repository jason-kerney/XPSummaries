### 1.	Focus on Communication and Shared Understanding. ###

The point of Acceptance Test-Driven Development is a shared understanding of what a story is supposed to do.

### 2.	Keep it small. ###

The fewer Acceptance Criteria, the easier it is to write and verify tests. Try to define stories around one idea with very few criteria.

### 3.	Acceptance tests do not replace other tests. ###

Acceptance tests are not as thorough as unit tests. They represent the spot-checking a PO might do to verify that the story works as the customer expected. Because of this, other tests are advised as well. This practice often supplements Test-Driven Development (TDD) quite well.

### 4.	Use the whole team when writing tests. ###

Since Acceptance Tests are large, over-arching tests, different people may understand them differently. Using the whole team to design the tests gives you a shared understanding of what the story does.

### 5.	Use Acceptance Test-Driven Development for Features ###

So far, this practice has been framed around stories. It is an incredible tool for story design and validation. But it can also be used for features. It has all the same benefits when used to define a feature. Defining small, distinct Acceptance Criteria for an Epic becomes more challenging, but there are huge advantages.
