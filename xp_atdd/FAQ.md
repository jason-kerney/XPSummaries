### How does this differ from Test-Driven Development? ###

Both are test-fist practices. TDD focuses on implementation and design. You will often have many more tests that come out of using it. In contrast, Acceptance Test-Driven Development focuses on communication and shared understanding.

### How does this differ from Behavior-Driven Development? ###

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is about a strict focus on business language. It can be used with TDD or with Acceptance-Driven Development. The difference is when the executable test is written, can the PO, or another Business Domain Expert, read the test code and understand what it does?  If so, the code was most likely written with BDD.
